# Two observable trends in the data:
    # 1. Charter schools overall have a higher average subject scores 
    #    as well as % passing rates.
    # 2. Most District Schools have a higher per student budget, 
    #    but a lower overall subject score and passing rate.
#  Analysis:
    #   In summary, the data shows that the scores and passing rates are much
    #   higher in charter schools than in district schools. There actually 
    #   isnt a single charter school with less than an 89% overall passing 
    #   rate, while the lowest district school overall passing rate is 52%.
    #   In fact, all of the district school's overall passing percentages 
    #   are between 52% and 54%, and charter schools are all between 89%
    #   and 91% overall passing. That's a huge difference.
