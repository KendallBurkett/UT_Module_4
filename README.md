## Description

**PyCitySchools** is a Python-based project that analyzes school performance data. The analysis includes comparisons of test scores, passing rates, and budgets for **charter schools** and **district schools**. Results highlight significant trends, including the relationships between per-student budgets and overall performance.

This project uses **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

## Features

- **School Performance Analysis**:
  - Calculates average math and reading scores for schools.
  - Determines overall passing rates for students.

- **Charter vs. District Schools**:
  - Compares subject performance between charter and district schools.
  - Analyzes the relationship between budget per student and school performance.

- **Data Aggregation**:
  - Merges datasets for schools and students.
  - Summarizes performance metrics for individual schools.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required libraries (if any) listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Setup**:
   - Clone this repository or download the project files.
     
   - Install dependencies (if needed):
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Results

### Key Observations

The following insights were derived from the analysis:
1.	Overall Passing Rates:
- * Charter Schools: 89% to 91% passing.
- * District Schools: 52% to 54% passing.
2.	Budget Impact:
- * District schools have a higher budget per student but perform worse overall in test scores and passing rates.
3.	Performance Comparison:
- * Charter schools consistently outperform district schools in both math and reading scores.
